How to use the code


The Polulu current sensor outputs a base voltage of the VCC/2(Roughly), and then is raised additionally 
based on the current going through the sensor at a flat rate that is dependent on the VCC. 

A steady conversion rate is heavily dependent on a steady VCC. The code below uses manual input 
to set whether or not there is a dc input and to set the base voltage outputted by the sensor,
as we are only calculating the additional voltage. 

Normally we could just use the formula and subtract the converted value from the solution 
to automate the calculation, but the sensor is very finicky, the ADC is very finicky and 
the formula is not very accurate, so we need a manual benchmark taken to get an accurate
reading.  

You will likely need to configurate both the base and the conversion rate based on your implementation
